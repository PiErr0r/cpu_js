# Crafting interpreters

following the book: _Robert Nystrom - Crafting Interpreters.pdf_

Interpreter: started in javascript (DEPRECATED: folder `interpreter`) and the rewritten and finished in typescript (folder `ts_interpreter`)
- initialize the folder: `npm install`
- to build ast files use `run_tool.sh` script
- to build the code use `npm run build`
- to run the code use `node build/install.js` after building
- to build and run the code use `node run start`
- running the code without arguments will start the `REPL` and when provided with `.lox` file will run it
